About the project
-----------------
This work was developed by myself, Piero Petten√†, for the internship of **Data Science and
Scientific Computing** master degree at **University of Trieste**. The project was supervised by:

- *Thetis IT S.r.l.*: the company that kindly hosted me during the internship
- *Prof. Lorenzo Castelli*: the professor that supervised the project
- *Dr. Federico Camerota*: the tutor that followed me during the internship

The project is the implementation of a ready-to-use platform to approximately solve the Dynamic
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Delivery with Time Windows (DCVRPPDTW). 
The platform is designed to be accessible and easy to use, with the possibility of executing
the optimization algorithm on any machine with Python installed (given a reasonably sized dataset).

The algorithm is based on An adaptive large neighborhood search for the multi-depot dynamic 
vehicle routing problem with time windows by Wang et al., 2024.
