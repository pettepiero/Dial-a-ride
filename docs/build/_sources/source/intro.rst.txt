The project
=======================

-----------------
About the project
-----------------
This work was developed by myself, Piero Petten√†, for the internship of **Data Science and
Scientific Computing** master degree at **University of Trieste**. The project was supervised by:

- *Thetis IT S.r.l.*: the company that kindly hosted me during the internship
- *Prof. Lorenzo Castelli*: the professor that supervised the project
- *Dr. Federico Camerota*: the tutor that followed me during the development of the thesis

The project is the **implementation of a ready-to-use platform to approximately solve the Dynamic
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Delivery with Time Windows (DCVRPPDTW)**. 
The platform is designed to be accessible and easy to use, with the possibility of executing
the optimization algorithm on any machine with Python installed (given a reasonably sized dataset).

The algorithm is based on the paper: *An adaptive large neighborhood search for the multi-depot dynamic 
vehicle routing problem with time windows* by Sihan Wang, Wei Sun and Min Huang, referenced with [WaSH24]_.
